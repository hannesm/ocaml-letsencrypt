(** [Letsencrypt]: for when you love authorities.

    Letsencrypt is an implementation of the ACME protocol, for automatizing the
    generation of HTTPS certificates.

    Currently, this library has been tested (and is working) only with
    Letsencrypt servers.

(** ACME Client.

    This module provides client commands.
    Note: right now this module implements only the strict necessary
    in order to register an account, solve http-01 challenges provided by the CA,
    and fetch the certificate.
    This means that you will be able to maintain your server with this, but there
    is no account handling: no implementation for account deletion, no implementation
    for challenges combination, no nothing.
